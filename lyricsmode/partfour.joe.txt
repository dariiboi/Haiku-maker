[Joe Budden]
Tell me how long are we supposed to act like this?
We won't never get on track like this
How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this?
You call me over here to talk, not get attacked like this
It's funny, got your track shoes on but what you runnin from?
Shit I know where you goin and where you comin from
That's immaturity showin, it's just the baby in you
One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you
Tired of hearin how you'll never trust me again
How you love me then you hate me then you love me again
One minute I'm your soulmate, then it's "fuck me" again
Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again
But check it, I just wan' treat you good and do better
You think I'm runnin 'round tryin to be the hood's Hugh Hefner
Say I'm all about hoes when I'm all about you
Even when I'm with my hoes I tell 'em all about you
Say that's just one reason I keep losin you
I don't understand it, that shit is confusin too
You left me, I'm doin me, you doin you
So what the FUCK does me doin me have to do with you?
How dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about them niggaz you fuckin with too
I'd have never knew you thought like that
Damn it, who knew that you was into sports like that?
More prayers cause they all players, you out there havin a ball playa
Ball player after ball player
I mean you with the ball players more than ball players
Hope they ain't fuckin you and makin you they ball-player
Come to me, I just get a hard time while they give one to you
Is this what you wan' do?
With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up
Start callin me a fuck up 'til I tell you shut the fuck up
Yeah, but the part I don't respect is
you so cool with e'ry other one of your exes
It's history between us, all ain't right either
Back and forth domestic, all ain't flights either
Be wantin you close to me, supposedly you say you over me
That just come across as a joke to me
Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires
Worst case you'll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar
Tried therapy when we felt it goin sour
That's 400 dollars every hour
For him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter
Tell me I need to lower my voice, don't curse at her
Says she only frustrated cause I keep hurtin her
Tell me despite all that he can tell that I worship her
Soon as you let your guard down I get it up again
Fixin it is too much work, so I give up again
But I wan' spend the rest of my LIFE wit'chu
Make a WIFE of you, make it all RIGHT wit'chu
But how you ever supposed to think that I'm RIGHT for you
when all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable?
Disgraceful, and you want me to chase you
But it's easier for me to replace you
Cause I see it like, if you can't deal with what we go through
I got bitches lined up, I got an ego too
And to them I'm everything, funny, I'm great and I'm charmin
But to you I'm alarmin, all I do is bring harm in
To you I'm the cause of all your misery
Of course I disagree, you goin off our history
All that arguin just ain't my style
Cause that anger now got us like strangers now
You tell me I should get help and I'm sick in the head
You found make up on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed
But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though
I could dead that bitch right now, man fuck that hoe
You just think I'll get another and another hoe
Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes
But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear
You goin through my phone like I got a bitch in there
We discussin chicks after they through
They don't matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you
Huh, we keep havin the same threesome
But not the kind that come as a blessing – nah
You keep bringin up my last girl like she ain't my past girl
Like you ain't the reason she present - check it
You ain't gotta worry about me and her
If I wanted to be with her, I would be with her
Yeah we hung together, strip clubs had fun together
But that's done, don't sweat her
Uh, you the only one I wan' do a bid with
Live with, share my last name, have kids with
Can't be understated anytime we ever dated
You compare me in your head to some nigga you created
I'm a long way from perfect, I got shit with me
Still I want you to love me unconditionally
Nine years in, I don't deserve what you givin me
Like you get a victory by actin like a dick to me
Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery
Lesson learned though, you my missin piece
Give another chance to your ex
You don't pick up the phone, you don't answer my texts
Bitch! We ain't give it all that we got
Still ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot
Or, we can go ahead on our own
I need you, I can't do this alone, no

[Outro: Brandon Hall]
But you keep runnin away! {*3X*}
But you keep runnin awayyyyyyyy!
But you keep runnin away...
But you keep runnin awayyyyyyyy!
But you keep runnin away! {*echoes*}</pre>
