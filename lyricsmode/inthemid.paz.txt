Artist: Vinnie Paz f/ Lawrence Arnell, Rite Hook, Slaine
Album:  Carry On Tradition (EP)
Song:   In the Middle of Nowhere
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah... Who's fucking house you think this is?

[Lawrence Arnell]
Destroyer of dreams, the bearer of bad news
I lay waste to your self-esteem and your attitude
So show gratitude, for leaving it right there
Instead of laying this left hook on your right ear
I'm a nightmare, so if you scared easily
Then keep pinching yourself, you'll awaken eventually
The same sympathy that have a dude sending just a dollar a day
To some poor kid in the middle east
Will have me taking your teeth out, instead of your knees
At the very least, it's one less mouth to feed
My family breed MCs with pedigrees
Master level artistry, so pardon me
If I appear to be speaking too cockily
But this is my house, you bout that? Then silence me
Or ride with me, the oddity, you on an odyssey
I'm obviously more than what your eyes can see

[Slaine]
My will is a bitter pill to swallow for the critical
Crazy since a baby, momma said I'd never sit still
Pacing like a pit bull, peering out the window seal with a pistol
My entire aura is sinful
It's hard to comprehend what I've seen and what I've been through
Nightmares and dreams in the means that you ain't meant to
See I grew up around fiends who robbed people for beans
And now they live in the scenes that I present you
They say the language of love is universal
But violence more commonly spoke
Especially when the government is plotting
And the love is all just rotten
Get a shotgun, you don't wanna be broke
A positive way of life, born in a winter cold froze
Raised in a human summer where the sinners hold toast
See them fall like the autumn or you spring from the bottom
But those old ghosts stand so close
You're in my house

One thing I know
I can see right through what you're about
I'm the last of a dying breed
You ain't welcome in my house
When the world turns into dust
Ain't trusting no one, no doubt
One thing I know
I can see right through what you're about
You're in my house

[Rite Hook]
Go ahead try puttin' the fire out
Coming outta my mouth, I'm a violent rhymer
Rhyme about the guys that'll ride around the downtown for hours
Yeah the ground I pound it
Sounds the same as when I swing in, buck your face
And my crew'll back me up when the cops are chasing me
Cause they just helped me stomp out imposters' brains
And they'll even get me off on a monster case
Cause money buys anything, so what you thinking chico?
I scream it in your face like you missing free throws
I'll throw your people off a bridge for cheap thrills
And keep killin' like it ain't shit to me still
I'm a dying breed, you're a dying human
Matter fact, you're a lying piece of shit, a pile of doodoo
If you ever get the chance, get a silencer and shoot you
Shoot yourself in the silence cause it suits you

[Vinnie Paz]
Lil' man, real power never changes hands
And that's the words of an alcoholic and jaded man
My whole life, I ain't never really gave a damn
It's different now, I engineered an amazing plan
I watched my life slip away like it was grains of sand
I'm back like I never left, but it was painful man
Everybody always hopeful that the plane will land
I rather live like a warrior, then the pain'll stand
I have a fractured psyche like David Ban
Bare knuckle a mothafucker and take his land
I'm simple now, more of a meat and potatoes man
Live at the barbecue with Joe Fatal fam
I'm cut from a different cloth, it's an ancient strand
I put the type of pressure on you that could break a dam
Keep my name out your mouth, Vinnie name is banned
I bring a rock to motherfuckers like a famous band

One thing I know
I can see right through what you're about
I'm the last of a dying breed
You ain't welcome in my house
When the world turns into dust
Ain't trusting no one, no doubt
One thing I know
I can see right through what you're about
You're in my house </pre>
