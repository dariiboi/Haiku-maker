Artist: Vinnie Paz f/ Blacastan, Sino, Zilla
Album:  Carry On Tradition (EP)
Song:   Bleed For Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo
I ain't even counting bars man you know what I'm sayin'
(Ew)
I'm just goin'

[Zilla]
Yo introducin' the illest spic, Zilla rip your heart out quick
I put a thought out with Paz and make the whole world sick
Boom bat snatch a rapper with my glue-like grip
I'm the equivalent of Bruce Lee, free-write this
Smack fire out the mic all day, sinister groove shit
Oooaah [?] and fightin' you on my cruise ship
Welcome to the planet where average niggas'll bruise quick
We can get it raw, call it using rhythm and blues fist
See I'm a monster, lock jaws, pop off
Rounds in the air, the block know it as [?]
They tried to say that I was destined to fail
Until I made my city question who could bring it as real
No deal, no dice, ain't luxury here
Instead it's kill or be killed and I ain't writing a will
Despite all the bullshit, nonsense, setbacks
I'm 'bout to show the world what your victory feel
Males stuck on some hood shit
My cousin clap a nigga quick
Your whole melon get split
One shot, why waste a whole clip?
A wood tip, my flow order niggas out of outta thinkin' they they shit
Fuck a ounce, grab a brick, break it down, flood the strip
Watch the law cuz they always tryna who doin' shit
Question: why niggas say they still affiliate with
I don't need fake friends when I'm dealing with shit
You can't trus 'em, fuck 'em, get 'em away quick
Before they start snitchin' and get you locked up quick
I bang a nigga, I ain't the type drop kick
Rainy days, dark nights, I still make a profit
They be really dressin' all black like they was gothic
Cry in the river like Justin over you casket
I'm always lookin' ahead, never dwellin' on bad shit
I never hold work Sino make it fast [?]

[Sino]
This OK corral, everbody's hands in the air
We fixin' to shut it down
Where the jewels and the paper at
Never a diplomat
Official Pistol Gang 'bout to run this town
It's the OK corral, everybody's hands in the air
We fixin' to shut it down
Where the jewels and the paper at
Never a diplomat
Official Pistol Gang 'bout to run this town come on!

[Vinnie Paz]
Every single rhyme I write make a buildin' collapse
It go from cell to cell, you can feel the synapse
Matter fact, I let Blac and Zill kill 'em with that
Three muhfuckas, three of the illest in rap
We treacherous three, that was the peel of rat
The Kool Moe D made it guerilla da rap
He winnin' LL when it is Phillips in fact
And at the same time brothers was dealin' with crack
Killin' 'em softly, Slaine was the villain in that
Kenny Gill, Vinnie real, he still is intact
You analog, I'm digital and I'm feelin' the dat
I've been raw, Tim Dog had the ceilin' on wax
Paul ritcheous teacher cuz I'm dealin' with facts
Was the price of reefer when you dealin' with math
Punch in a sucker rapper, maybe I'm guilty for that
He just another rapper, y'all know my feelin's on that

[Blacastan]
Chauvinistic mysogonistic in every spot I visit
Bitches get twisted, my G simplistic
Even fat bitches get crushed too cuz I'm optimistic
Director's chair, life is like a motion picture
Scene from The Godfather, beat ya like Sunny's sister
Apocalypse now, Black Hawk down
Nigga's talk loose now, but they softer than goose downs
I'm payin' no attention, layin' low like the benz suspension
Crazily slept on, but still get an honorable mention
Prophetical, last man standin' like The Book of Eli
Lost in Italy, I'm trying to find a pair of felines
Back to states where the steaks is great
Feelin' ahead leavin' them bleedin like females menstruate
Death to those who chose to throw arrows at the pharaohs
Incineratin' your block, douse you with the Tommy Gun barrels
Official Pistol Gang, bangin' guns like Al-Qaedo

[Sino]
This OK corral, everbody's hands in the air
We fixin' to shut it down
Where the jewels and the paper at
Never a diplomat
Official Pistol Gang 'bout to run this town
It's the OK corral, everybody's hands in the air
We fixin' to shut it down
Where the jewels and the paper at
Never a diplomat
Official Pistol Gang 'bout to run this town come on!</pre>
