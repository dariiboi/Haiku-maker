Song:   See It Through
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In a world fill with hate
And I know I ain't safe
I open up so that you relate
You can see through another day

Expect the unexpected and don't you question faith
See that's my favorite method
But now it's been replaced
Cuz I've been dying on the inside
And bleeding out
If theres a God
Will you answer me I need you now
Just hear me out and tell me what the fuck's been going on
Cuz people reaching out and lately I've been so withdrawn
I've grown so weak
How much more can I truly take
How can I improve if I don't learn from my mistakes
I stay up late contemplating what my life is for
And every night I hear the devil knocking on my door
I go to war nearly every second that I breathe
Demons sucking on my soul just like a fucking leech (fucking leech)
I really try to practice what I preach
I'm tryna set a good example for the kids I reach
But what's the point if I can't even reach my fucking self
Sometimes I shut down and keep all of my feelings shelved

In a world filled with hate
We forget what love feels like
And I know I ain't safe
But I'm here cuz it feels right
I open up so that you relate
Your not alone this is real life
You can see through another day
Keep your faith right by your side

Optimistic dreams with pessimistic outcomes
The more success
Which I gain comes with fucking problems
From Chicago where they hate to see you make it out
The more you progress, the faster they gone take you out
I know some cats who want to fuck me up and catch me slippin
And when that day comes I hope they know that they're forgiven
Cuz I don't harvest any hatred for a fucking soul
Cuz deep inside everybody has a heart of gold

There's too much love for me to hold a grudge
There's too much purity inside my heart to let corrupt
Don't give a fuck if they gone box me up below the dirt
Cuz they can take away my life
But not take what i'm worth
So stand for something dawg
Or you can die for nothing
The truth is what I symbolize they see what I'm becoming
And I ain't fucking running yo ain't backing down from shit
I speak upon this mic
Open up to you and spread my gift

In a world filled with hate
We forget what love feels like
And I know I ain't safe
But I'm here cuz it feels right
I open up so that you relate
Your not alone this is real life
You can see through another day
Keep your faith right by your side

In a world filled with hate
We forget what love feels like
And I know I ain't safe
But I'm here cuz it feels right
I open up so that you relate
Your not alone this is real life
You can see through another day
Keep your faith right by your side

In a world filled with hate
We forget what love feels like
And I know I ain't safe
But I'm here cuz it feels right
I open up so that you relate
You not alone this is real life
You can see through another day
Keep your faith right by your side</pre>
