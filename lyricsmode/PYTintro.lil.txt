Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Video that top of the world
High school hustle came with the muscle
Been in battle all set came awful
Niggas mad at my draw step
The game and the ring now these bitches wanna forfeit
Money on my mind and I ain't talking about that bullshit
This motivation send the people in the poor pit
Middle class rich, money heading down
And it's a gift and a curse
It gets much worse when you hear the news
That's when you say the truth hurts
You feel me? but how do you live
When I feel separate
Under the 1 percent, only one that came through
Still came new, pump the rains in the backyard
I lean over, my tie back
Tryin' to sell the house
The land can't bill me out
The type of drugs that you couldn't even count
I had to put it right to the door
Next to the Jesus piece
Stuck the dope in the floor
Got a little greedy, people wanted more
I'm going in and everybody at war
Pretty young thug 'cause my niggas wanted more
This my time
PYT mixtape
