Song:   Call Casting
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Sample (Takeoff)]
Buddah blessed this beat
(Yeah, trap shit
No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Takeoff]
Up early in the morning, trapping (Trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (Ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (Beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (Mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (Eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (Yeah)

Ac (Ac)
Put the backends in the back (Back)
Draco on me, it's attached (Attached)
Name a nigga with the pack (Pack)
Name a nigga with the sack (Sack)
I love my Glock, I got the Mac (Mac)
She eat the Molly like a snack (Eat it up)
It's gold on my nickel plaque (plaque)
Bando Shane's Rib Shack (Eat it up)
Bought the plug, give it tax (Tax)
Sip the lean and relax (Drink it up)
Park the Lamb in the back (Skrt, skrt)
Big dog, you a cat (Cat)
Rich and the matte black (Skrt, skrt)
Twenty hoes to be exact (Yeah)
I mean ten, that's a dime
More than nickels, that's a five (Yeah)
Wanna fly, wanna slide?
Wanna glide? Ain't got time (Yeah)
Pour a thirty on my nine
For a nigga out of line (Yeah)
Momma cryin', niggas dyin'
Wonder why they grip the fire Yeah

Up early in the morning, trapping (Trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (Ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (Beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (Mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (Eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (Yeah)

[Quavo]
Brrrrt, skrrrt, skrrrt, skrrt, skrrrt
Pot!
Niggas tried to send the thot
Thatâ€™s the only way to plot
Klay Thomp corner shot (Brrr)
Eight-ball, corner pocket (Ay)
White boys in the game (White)
Call 'em Andy Milonakis (Yeah)
He won't hesitate to shoot em (Shoot)
Private jet to Bermuda (Woo)
I knew I been had sauce (Who)
Cause I was fuckin' on my tutor (Who)
Truck backin' up the dooley
A hundred pounds out the cooler
Came from a cup of noodles
I fucked the game, karma sutra
I got Ms on my mind
I got boulders in my time
Put a model bitch on coca
Tell 'em read between the lines (Coco)
Jays out there snitchin' (Yeah)
Heard it through the vine (Jays)
Packin' up the kitchen
Think I ran out of time (yeah)

[Takeoff]
Up early in the morning, trapping (Trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (Ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (Beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (Mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (Eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (Yeah)

[Offset]
Woo woo woo woo woo
Packs (Pack)
I paid the ticket, get you wacked (Brrr)
I chop the brick with the axe (Hey)
The Cookie smellin like a casket (Cookie)
I'm sellin' crack in my Rafs (Crack)
Put the addy in the nav (Addy)
You steady poppin' even though its capped (Cap)
I hit the jungle and then adapt
30 thousand on the couch (30 bars)
All my bitches from my app (app)
Instagram and the Snap (Snap)
I bet a hundred on the craps (Crap)
I'm good on shawty, do without
She fucking niggas for the check (Check)
Imma only get the mouth
I bought a Lambo crossover on a bitch
I poured a four, Actavis
Walk in Goyard, got a bag for my bitch
Won't get a kiss cause I know you suck dick
Spend you hundred Philippe on your wrist (Patek)
Twenty-five pointers, one fist (Points)
Twenty-five bitches on list (25)
Kilo ten rubber band grip (Brrr)

[Takeoff]
Up early in the morning, trapping (Trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (Asking)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (Beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (Mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (Eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (Yeah)</pre>
