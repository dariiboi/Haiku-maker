(Verse 1, Kilo Ali)
I met this girl in Atlanta, let me play in her mizzouth
She get my dick so hizzard, it never go sizzoft
From the side to the side, the bitch gon' get it all
From the top of my dizzick to the bottom of my bizzall
I feel her fingernail when she grab it and beat it
She ready to eat it whenever I skeet it
She did it in the dark but in the light she won't do it
She be unzipping my pants and she be getting straight to it
No, it was not a dream
Even though that's what it seem
I kick, I scrat-I skit-I sca-I scream
And she was feelin' freaky, she was feelin' fine
I didn't feel her teethy, I only felt her tongue
Relax; I'm gettin' massaged by the masseuse
She wouldn't let me gizzo, she wouldn't let me loose
I don't know her, she was somebody else
But I was happy, that's what I said to myself
But the shit was nothin' new, she do it anyway
She didn't wanna talk she ain't got nothin' to say but

(Hook)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)

(Verse 2, Big Boi)
Makin love off in your jaw cavity
Haven't we seen eachother before?
Slow thinkin, giving you throat babies
Give to them dead and broke lady
But lately I've been thinkin and dreamin about you and your suction
Daddy fat sack's gon' be payin them pros and takin them hoes to lunches
But I be fuckin' and duckin' and dodgin'
Never the one to be callin
I'm followin 'em 'round like lap dogs
Just lay in the 'Lac and slap jaws
Seventy-nine Seville still
Look, how bout we roll to Ben Hill Grill
This thang real, like oatmeal and sit real
But I was supposed to meet my love here
Supposed to be live happily, that's in our family
She mad at me, the status of my penis, and my anatomy

(Hook)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)

(Verse 3, Kilo Ali)
I take three little bitches and I put 'em in a line
I take four-five-six, and blow them hoes mind
It'll take one more before I go for mine
But seven bitches get fucked at the same time
I say eats me, son she... she can suck a "Ding-A- -All day, All night, All evening- -Long"
Said she never done it, she said she never tried
She's sittin there tellin a motherfuckin' lie
Now how many licks does it take to make my dick spit?
Well how many licks if the bitch is a good trick?
Now, any nigga could talk to a bitch and get the bitch to fuck
But, how many niggas could talk to the bitch and get they dick sucked like me?
A pimp that you never saw!
Now how do you say ménage à trois?
When my shit get soft, she make my shit get long
Oh she love down, she love down, she love it raw

(Hook)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
Ohhh, uh-oh, ahh-ah-oh
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
We make love
Sho-nuff, we makin love
Allll in her mouth
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes you can)

(Verse 4)
From the crème de la crème
Dick off to the rim-a
Bring me all the girls cause me fuckin' all of dem
With me big preacher Paul, yes yes y'all
Me dick is not too big, dem pussy just too small
Ha! Me laugh, women brag
Wipe me dick off with the rag
Nuff respect due to the pussy I just had
And she holler like she dying, dick off to her spine
I said there, there crying woman there will be no crime
Mmmmm, I can be your lover tonight
Mmmmm, no one else can do like I can
Mmmmm, girl give me just one try
Hurt me, hurt me, but I won't cry</pre>
