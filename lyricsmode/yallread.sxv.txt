[Intro/Interlude: DJ Premier scratches]
"Yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo"
"This your man, Royce Da 5'9"..."
"This your dude, Crooked I.."
"And then, it's Jumpoff Joe Beezy.."
"Y-y-y-y-yaowa, yaowa, it's Joell Ortiz"

[Chorus: scratched sample of Joell Ortiz]
"Y'all 'ready... y'all 'ready..."
"Y'all 'ready know, Sl-Slaughterhouse"

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, lil' niggaz get your weight up, fuck y'all, pay up
My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up
Nicer than me, say what? Wait up, straight up
I finish niggaz right off the bat, like a lay-up
I seen a lot of come (come) I seen a lot of go (go)
But y'all know where I'm from (where?) B-R-double O
You know the rest pimpin, yeah I was bred different
Here come pops with the N.Y. bop, you know the leg limpin (yaowa)
My ice mug frozen 'til it's stiff
Grimy nigga, might wan' hold onto your bitch
I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women
Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em (uhhh)
I might just throw on my gold fronts
Pour a cup of E&J and light up a 'dro blunt
I was never soft, never saw me flinchin when they lettin off
Never had to retaliate cause I set it off

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all know my name bitch, never change up my language
I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt
First we take oath
Then I'm pullin turquoise strings in my LeBron Corks in Turks and Caicos
I came from wicker chair fame wearin short sets
I learned that money can't buy happiness
But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin in the Corvette
Make a dollar, buy a suit - have a child and have 'em follow suit
Wavin that weather change thing
Make the winter fall, comin through with everything to lose
Takin everything from you know
Let him finish his fall in his draws and pray that he land on the minute hand in my Hublot
I'm about that Art of War gospel
That Basquiat Picasso drawin a roscoe
Usin the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow
Your money on me, bet it all - you know I'ma set it off

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Uhh, let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth
Truth is I give a FUCK, but it's right to myself
Fuck fame, I keep the shit I write to myself
If what I do is therapeutic, man the slightest shit helps
Met angel dust my freshman year, gave it a try, cool
Little did I knew had the wrong meanin of high school
Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar
FUCK them! Only went to class for the cyphers
Now I'm gettin bills for
the same thinkin they tried to prescribe pills for
They said I needed a wrench - I'm a loose screw, vital
Suicidal, said I would kill me or more/amor, wasn't speakin in French
Said I'd let it off
Never know who or what you might get, main reason they never want me to set it off
You now dealin with four niggaz that's never off
All bets are off, so nah, y'all won't be better off

[Chorus]

[Crooked I/KXNG CROOKED]
Uh, Jewish tats on my arm like a Semitic boss
Egyptian ankh hangin, that's my Kemetic cross
Slaughterhouse set it off
Even got bitches wavin our flag, Betsy Ross
Old school Chevy, the head is off, decapitated Impala
Heavy 'llac from the weight of the llama
Still bear/bare arms like a shaven koala
Higher thinkin like a faded neurology student is prudent when chasin a dollar
So never mind, a clever rhyme
I'd rather find, a better grind, forever times
Sittin behind me cause I'm ahead of mine
In this era I'm, livin outside of the paradigm
I'm comin outside with a pair of dimes
Sharon and Caroline share a line, then they share a 9 inch, never mind
I probably shouldn't even keep goin
Cause these rappers keep hoein with their teeth showin
I set it off~!

[Chorus]
