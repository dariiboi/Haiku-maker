Artist: Kilo Ali
Album:  Organized Bass
Song:   Lost Y'all Minds
Typed by: MdNghtXTC@aol.com, r0llinlacs@yahoo.com

(Hook x4)
Lost y'all mind (Oh, Lord)
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind (Oh, God)
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind
And it made my cry, cry, cry

(Verse 1)
Alright, once again it's me
Kilo Ali with positivity
You want some loot so you got to hustle
Drug dealers ain't nothin' but trouble
Do the crime, you got to pay the price
What you gon' tell Jesus Christ?
He don't smoke and he don't get high
Where the kingpin go after they die?
Cause it's a sin to sell
Brother you could go to jail or you could go to hell
What about a brother thinkin' he a pimp though?
When he calls our mother a trick ho?
Or his cousin, or his sister, or his auntie?
Boy! You better learn to love the ladies
I think you slippin, but you think you pim-pim-pimpin
Four nickels and a dime, some of y'all done lost y'all mind
I said four nickels and a dime, some of y'all done lost y'all mind

(Hook x4)

(Verse 2)
Since I made White Horse, they think I hate white folks
Ah man, that gotta be a white joke
It ain't what I done to my country, it's what my country done to me
Red, white, and blue, the flag again
I'll burn it, black American
I gotta stand up for myself
Either give me freedom or give me death
When I rap for the blacks, white folks don't like to hear me talk like that
Black cop'll lock me up faster
He'd be a contender of the master
And I'm lookin' for a brother, but he called me a black mother (Sigh...)
So I looked him in his eyes, and he made me cry, cry, cry
I know you gotta make you a living
But why you gotta hurt my feelings
Four nickels and a dime, some of y'all done lost y'all mind

(Hook x4)

(Verse 3)
See the world is a zoo
And if you live in the world then I'm talkin 'bout you
Try to touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can
See all we really need to do is keep the love in our hearts, and we all survive
Without God we have nothing, with God we have everything
Yes, that's why I always said
I said money and clothes, beamers and vogues
I'd rather go to heaven than any of those
Money and clothes, beamers and vogues
I'd rather go to heaven than any of those
Money and clothes, beamers and vogues
I'd rather go to heaven than any of those
Money and clothes, beamers and vogues
I'd rather go to heaven than any of those
Money and clothes, beamers and vogues
I'd rather go to heaven than any of those</pre>
