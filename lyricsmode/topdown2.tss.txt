Artist: Too $hort
Album:  Top Down (S)
Song:   Top Down (Part II)
Typed by: Damontae Edwards

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind

How freaky can you get to a Morning Strip?
Hella freaky like I said to a song that hit
I'm the dirty rapper Too Short, the Rated X
I Got The Girls, Cause You're Hated Than Sex
Which is worse, my bark or my bite?
You heard about me and now I'm Jocking you
All Day & Night
You must of thought I got nicer, talking about Heiser
I'm an old dogg and old dogg's get wiser
Caught up in the game, got ya thinking while your doing this
You never did this, Hangin' With The Big Pimp
You Know What? You better check the size, and recognize
When I'm between your thighs
Ride, I get hard from the sound of a kick drum
Laughing And Smiling They Be Watching A Sitcom
Shiny bald head catching sun rays
Going backwards down runways
Four eighteens with the zues and the Zapco
Sounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show
Hit a back street and put the top up
Stopped at the light see some Girls watch 'em jock us
I'm so roll with my electric top
Hit a button, ain't gotta get out, Touch with nuthin
I'm Let the top And just lay down
Slamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds
Everybody knows when Short's in town
Cause I keep the beats thumping hella hard with my top down


Drop the top
Just drop the top

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

Nine albums out, ain't changed my talk
A thousands girls walked on I'm still a dogg
Ain't changed nuthing but That Ain't No Love
Still riding through the hood all the homies say "What's up?"
Give me my props cause I always rock
And I still gets top But They Just Won't Stop
Still smoking Indo getting burned out
Still got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out
A show, a smashed back to the O
Put them Freaks on my beeper then pull some mo'
Cause we y'all straight bump than acne
What can you learn that you just can't mack me?
I'm off of Gin and Juice, don't even introduce
If you ain't with it back up cause I'm finna choose
I want some freaks that could make me write a Freaky Tale
Drawls back, Moving Pack, up in a hotel
Just to say you got some Too Short
You wanna show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit
Cause I bust more nuts than a squirrel
And my tapeâ€™s been in decks all around the world
If you had a copy of it and you asked the fan
"What's that?" I bet you say, "Too Short, Man"
I still taunt the fine girl and get shot down
I say "[edited]," slam the beat, smash off with my top down

Just riding with my top down

Good times, these are the good times
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Drop The Drops!!

We rode the AC transit bus
Selling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust
On the way to a house party, a maybe delux
Selling Too Short tapes, making some bucks
Looking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew
Asking myself "How can you?"
Roll like the Giants down the foothill strip
With beats thumping top down Lovin' It
See I had to have drop, didn't care if I had a Volkswagon
Pick up the beat, had a Whole flaging
Siding with the top down, lit like a lamp
Blowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp
Most Players couldn't afford to have a drop top
So they got they get cut at the chop shop
Couldn't tell fools nuthin way back then
A lot of homies died or they went to the pen
Couldn't even see the homie Short Bubble
Bank get fat and my whole account double
When I walk in a club Girls say "Ooh God
Is that you Todd?"
Me and my homies just hoo-ride
And take advantage of a life we never had
Stop eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad
I'ma do it for my homies that's there in lock down
Ride with my beats slamming top down</pre>
