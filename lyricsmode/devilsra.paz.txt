Song:   The Devil's Ransom
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Jarren Benton]
Yeah, sniffing Oxycontins to medicate
I'll cut your fucking head off then I lick the machete blade
I'm so unorthodox that a pussy get torn out the box
Body parts inside the freezer, never let the corpses rot
Yeah!, Don't like bitches, did he talk a lot?
I spit a couple lines, and got this trick up out her halter top
Mr. Benton, Amber alert your bitch is missin'
I'm in the kitchen, twitchin', I need a fix my skin is itchin'
I took a piss in public, got a misdemeanor
I'm cheap, I take a bitch to Arby's, get her chicken fingers
Twistin' some reefer, got her twisted to demeanor
They kick me out of Sunday school for hittin' the preacher
Started drinking gasoline cause I'm sick of tequila
I'll eat through the fucking speakers and shoot at ya teacher
My high is coming down, feel like I'm a finna crash
Go on a killing spree, and murder rappers with Vinnie Paz
(Ahah! Jarren Benton! What up Vinnie!?)

[Lawrence Arnell]
I guess you thinkin' this what you built for
You killed a couple lines, homie we done killed more
You wanna battle, we brought a war
Break out the chain mail, swing a fucking sword
I guess you thinkin' this what you built for
You killed a couple lines, homie we done killed more
You wanna battle, we brought a war
Break out the chain mail, swing a fucking sword

[Vinnie Paz]
You give a mother fucker an inch, she take a yard
That just mean I'm have to rearrange her faith in God
I'm robbing every mother fucker, making Satan starve
Create a spell inside the gates of hell, and take his job
The drums is always mad heavy and the bass is hard
How are you pulling all the strings you got a fake guitar
Wild cowboy, punch you in your facial part
I drink my liquor from a mother fucking mason jar
I shine when I rhyme, like a mother nature star
You pussies always backing up like you was David Carr
Give me the weakest fucking beat, and I can make it raw
Performing heart surgery with a serrated sword
Not even Frank Ocean is afraid of y'all
Matter fact, he's taking off his shirt so he can bathe with y'all
A'yo Jarren why you have to be amazing for it
Take the Whitney out, and bump the cutter like we playing ball

[Lawrence Arnell]
I guess you thinkin' this what you built for
You killed a couple lines, homie we done killed more
You wanna battle, we brought a war
Break out the chain mail, swing a fucking sword
I guess you thinkin' this what you built for
You killed a couple lines, homie we done killed more
You wanna battle, we brought a war
Break out the chain mail, swing a fucking sword

[Sinister laughs]
Swing a fucking sword...
[Sinister laughs]
You wanna battle, we brought a war
Break out the chain mail, swing a fucking sword
[Sinister laughs]</pre>
