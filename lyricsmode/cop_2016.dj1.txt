Song:   Cop Hell 2016
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: J-Zone]
Yo Chief, why the fuck is your arm in a sling?
What the fuck happened to you, man?

[Chief Chinchilla]
Man, I was down at the Note checkin out my man DJ Rude One (Word?)
I was about to leave with this bitch, had a body like a MAYTAG~! (Ehhaha!)
I had a warrant though, the cops arrested me, man
Beat me up, fucked up!

[J-Zone] (Chief)
Aw shit! Damn, they fucked you up like that?
I gotta talk about these muh'fuckers, I'm tired of this shit

I'm sendin cops to Cop Hell (Get 'em!) with gasoline draws (draws!)
Another brother courted on some probable cause (Word?)
Courtesy of America's number one gang of roughnecks
The +Blue Man Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit+
Mad enough to get my roll on (Get 'em!)
And if they call us thugs instead of niggaz, go on and fuck up that patrol car!
(I got first!) Cause I respect a dude who don't, sugarcoat the truth
You don't trust me, I don't trust you and cooperate and FUCK YOU!
(Fuck you!) Get that flashlight out of my face
OH SHIT~! Another poo butt cop with a crew cut (Look at the guy!)
who sells what he confiscates, even to constitute sluts
His wife wants a divorce cause he left her all bruised up
(Yo Zone, could you please stop dissin 5-0?)
Chief, why try? Crooked pigs deserve to die slow
Slugs hit a crooked cop in the face and give him dimples
Now he here lookin like Ma$e for treatin us like criminals (Aw shit!)
Punk I thought I told you that, we won't stop
Naw, I didn't +Invent the Remix+, but peep this!
Real +Bad Boys+ don't pop Cristal on a Arista imprint (Hell no!)
They'll kill you and give your man who film the shit you a sentence
(Ain't that some shit?)
So it's only human for an otherwise peaceful man to want vengeance (Word!)
I know all cops (uh), ain't bad people
Neither are all pimps, dope dealers and thieves, so what the FUCK does that mean?!
You wanna ring my bell? Ya fuckin A right
It ain't no snitchin, it's a war and we're livin in Cop Hell
(Fuck away from me, man)
