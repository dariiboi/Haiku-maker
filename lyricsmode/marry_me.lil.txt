Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now baby come hold my hand
I wanna be your man
I wanna see you every night
I've been waiting all my life
I love you to the moon and the stars
Don't change who you are
You are the love of my life
We gonn be alright
I can show you all those things
Whatever money brings
Can you just be my wife?
And if I give you this ring
Can you promise me?
To love me until I die

I'm thinking bout getting married
All the pain and the sacrifice s
I'm thinking bout getting married
Of life and friendship
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married
The whole world ahead of us
I'm thinking bout getting married
You and me girl
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married
I'm thinking bout getting married

And everybody says what's a do?
Girl it's just me and you
I know your family thinks I'm wild
Last night I had a dream
It was just you and me
Girl I want you to have my child
And I'll take you to the moon and the stars
Don't change who you are
Let me know I'm worth your while
And if you take this diamond ring
That will change everything
I want you to be my wife, whoa
I love you girl, and I hope you accept this
And I hope you accept my family
I want you to be my wife
I wanna say, I wanna marry you
I hope you accept this
Just marry me, listen to me
Just marry me, I want you to
Just marry me, I need you girl
Just marry me, I love you
It's dedication, just marry me
All the pain and the love
Just marry me, what do you think?
Just marry me, all our base
Got a full life ahead
Just marry me, just marry me
I love you girl
