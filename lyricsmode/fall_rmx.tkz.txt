Song:   Fall For Your Type (Remix)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, I'd take a shot for you and everything we did
And everything we once was in our relationship
Everything was straight when we first started dating
Thought I'd never see the day when it's both our hearts breaking
So I'm drinking every weekend, speaking sober thoughts
Staring at my phone, wondering if I should call
Tell you how I feel, cause the pain still hasn't healed
Everything feels out of place, I think a part of me was killed
When I let you go, thinking we could take it slow
But one weeks past, already found another man to hold
I should have known, I mean you're in college right
You probably met someone at some fucking party right
I seen it coming, but chose to ignore it
In hopes that we could find each others love and then restore it
But you went out exploring, exploring like its a game
And I'm just sitting back like why the fuck do things change
Cause things change and there ain't shit that you can do about it
But take blame for all the bullshit that you provided
I can't deny it, I've made my mistakes
But I was trying to fix em' and now it's too late

Uh, so I guess this is it, my final words
I really do wish the best for you, even if it hurts
I hope you find yourself a better dude, one that you deserve
I hope he does what I could never do and show you what it's worth
When it works, imagine love without a struggle
Just happiness and peace where the couple never crumbles
A stumble here and there, but the sound is so subtle
Cause love remains humble when the world seems to rumble
And I promise you, you won't dare forget my name
When you needed help, I'm the one who always fucking came
I'm the one who picked you up when you slipped up in the rain
I'm the one who took you back when you left me in such pain
You remember that, all that bullshit you said
You'll love me till the end, but you're loving him instead
I can bet what you're giving him comes from your regrets
You can have it, sincerely
A love that was never meant to be</pre>
