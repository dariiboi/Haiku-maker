Song:   Thinking About You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can you tell me what ya name is
See I been thinking bout you
I don't care who you came with or give a damn who's around you
I just wanna get to know you, I swear this all feels so new
So can you give me one chance now and let ya past be old news

So can you give me one chance now? And let ya past be old news
I don't ever really chase much
This gone take some getting used to
I don't know what it is yo but you caught my attention
I been staring at you all night and I know you feel the tension
See I got a couple questions, If you give me the time of day
I want your love and affection
I can heal all your heartbreaks
If you want we can take it slow, ain't no need for us to rush this
We can see if our bond grows, you may be the one I fall in love with

Can you tell me what ya name is
See I been thinking bout you
I don't care who you came with or give a damn who's around you
I just wanna get to know you, I swear this all feels so new
So can you give me one chance now and let ya past be old news

I know we're both still young but that done mean much
You could have really been the one
I've been hurt before
So I know what it's like to distance yourself from the world out of spite
So trust me tonight just let yourself go
Just open your heart and your mind and your soul
Who knows what can happen, If you let me in
I could be there for you through both thick and thin
Through all of your struggles and all of your problems
I could pick you up when you hit the bottom
Trust me you got me and I won't be leaving
If you give me purpose the I'll give you reason
Reason to smile
Reason to love
When you think of passion
It's me you speak of
I'll never let go, if you hold me tight
What happens tonight, can last us our whole life
Can last us our whole life
What happens tonight, can last us our whole life
If you don't believe me then give it a try
and if I turn out right I'm gone stay by your side
I'm gone stay by your side through ups and the downs
I'll be there for the ride
I'll be there for the ride and when you're lost
I'm the one who you will find
I'm the one you will find
I'm the one you will find
I'm the one you will find
And when you're lost I'm the one you will find

Can you tell me what ya name is
See I been thinking bout you
I don't care who you came with or give a damn who's around you
I just wanna get to know you, I swear this all feels so new
So can you give me one chance now and let ya past be old news</pre>
