Song:   If I Should
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Joseph Kay]
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here

[Jaytekz]
What is life if you can't make the most of it?
What is love if you can't get a hold of it?
What's a smile if you’re not really happy?
Wake up everyday with a frown feeling crappy
Tell me what is laughter when you just want to cry
And life is a disaster and you just want to die
Nobody understands how you feel deep inside
But you got to stay strong with your head held high
I got so many questions
Yeah, why is life such a bitch when you least expect it?
And how does everybody have it all figured out?
As I sit and pout, this shits so depressing
Fuck, I'm so emotional
I guess these are the thoughts of a broken soul
With a broken heart, outspoken mind
I'm trying to find who I am on this path of mine
But I don't know, I don't know
It's been a long time since I felt like myself
I might as well grab the nine and take the safety off
And let the bullet pierce right through my scalp
Shit, I need help
Shit, I need help
Shit, I need help
I don't really know who the fuck I can turn to
I try to take my time and listen to advice
See, I was told patience is a virtue
But I'm sick and tired of being sick of life
Fuck tomorrow, I want to die tonight
Fuck the future, fuck the present
Fuck the drama
Yo, fuck the stressing
Fuck the judgements, fuck assumptions
Fuck the ones who made me feel like nothing
Fuck ‘em all, yo I’m done talking
Stay the fuck away when I’m inside my coffin

[Joseph Kay]
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here

[Jaytekz]
Everyday is a burden for me
So many regrets, it discourages me
Like where would I be if I didn't drop out
And I kept taking classes and grandma was proud?
And where would I be if my father was here?
And mom was with him and their love was sincere
No fucking divorce, no need for the courts
Together forever, they fought through the storms
They fought through it all
Yeah, through the trials of love, they never quit
But it's sad to say that that's not the case
Cause they broke apart, that shit makes me pissed
Yo, fuck
Yo, fuck
Do I give up or do I stand on my feet?
Do I give in to the hardships of life
Living every single as I die on my knees
Shit, what should I do? What should I do?
Do I hold on to this thing called life?
Do I stay strong when there’s tears in my eyes?
Do I move on when I'm hurting inside?
Where do I go? Where do I go?
Under the ground when I'm finally at peace
Away from the world, away from the sorrow and pain
That's been hidden within me so deep

[Joseph Kay]
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here
Oh no, I don't know if I should be here, be here</pre>
