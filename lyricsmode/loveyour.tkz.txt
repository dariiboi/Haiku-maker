Song:   Love Yourself
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So I heard the other day you finally found someone else who's better
And if its meant to be I truly hope it lasts forever
Cause you and I together really wasn't practical
Arguing every second cause your mind still wasn't rational
Like how you tell me that I can't go out
Can't have a few drinks with a couple low pals
But here you are getting drunk at every single weekend
You say your with your girls but I bet you cheating
And mamma told me there something fishy going on
From the first time she met you know something was wrong
But I ain't pay attention, I was optimistic,
thought we saw a future but you lost your vision
Shit happens so I couldn't really blame you
But you went behind my back and was unfaithful
You really broke me and fucked me up inside
You told me that you loved me but that was just the biggest lie

And she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself

So a couple months passed by and you hit me up
I thought that chu was over me, you even wished me luck
But then you started crying, you told me you was sorry
You said you fucked up cause now you can't forget about me
And that's what happens when you take one for granted
Gave you all I had all you did was take advantage
Fuck it, I really hope you learned your lesson
Karma is a bitch she's gonna show her affection
And to be honest I ain't holding no grudges
My hearts still bruised but I'm rolling with the punches
Still wish the best for you, and nothing less for you
I speak highly when somebody ever mentions you
But when its all said and done I wasn't meant for you
But you gotta be a women and accept the truth
Gotta let go, you gotta move on
You gotta learn that's so much to improve on

And she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself</pre>
