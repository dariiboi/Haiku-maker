Album:  I'm Better (S)
Song:   I'm Better
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dining room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Missy]
He say I'm hot, I'm so fuego
Pull up on him in my vehicle
He say I'm pretty, I'm pretty
You must be from Brazil, it must be from Me-hico
Roll up on him in my Lambo
Jump out like skrrrt, yeah bro
You need a chick like me to make you wanna leave them other broads
you don't know nann hoe

Yeah he got bands in the Bando
Missy got dudes in Orlando
Plus I got cars that he paying for
Man I be too much to handle
Watch what I do, when I get up on you
Pop potential in my room and zoom in the poom
He watching my body like he watching Scandal
But I'm just here, with my girls

[Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dining room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Missy]
Missy so hot, I'm from VA
The car that I drive be Ferr-ar-i
My clique is so thick and the broads be hollin' and whistlin'
That be like damn bae
Man I'm 3000, I'm Andr√©
Yo Missy talk big, I'm so grande
Bruce Lee on the beat, I don't compete with none of these geeks
I just rant like I'm Kanye

Yeah he got bands in the Bando
Missy got dudes in Orlando
And I be driving cars he paying for
He say I'm too much, I'm a handful
He watching my body like watching Scandal
But I'm just here, with my girls

[Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dining room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Missy]
Brand new flow when I rap
DJ, bring that back
You ain't ever heard a track like that
Shit might slap, booty go clap
Roll up in the Benz
Looking like a ten, stack
When I rock, make it bop, in my car
And it bang-bang-bang like (tune-out noise) go blap-blap-blap

Yeah he got bands in the Bando
Missy got dudes in Orlando
Buying me bags and new shoes and new cars
and everything I know that he paying for
Yeah he be hooking me up
Yeah he be looking me up
Watch what I do, when I get up on you
Pop potential and zoom in the poom

[Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dining room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better</pre>
