Song:   Better Man
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Silver Skye]
I remember you said you could only fall in love once
You looked in my eyes and said I was the one
Tell me right now where it went wrong
'Cause once he came in, you left now you're gone
I don't understand, was he a better man?

Everything you telling him you told me
The way that you would be holding him, you'd hold me
He is doing everything I use to do
And I would have gave the world to you
You're teaching him everything I taught you
Sharing with him everything I bought you
I don't understand, was he a better man?

[JayteKz]
See I don't get it
You told me that you love me right
How the fuck did you move forward nearly overnight?
I gave you everything, everything a man could give
You make me feel so fucking worthless
I don't want to live
I see your face almost everywhere I go
We could of had the world but I guess now we will never know
And that's your fault
Breaking us up was your cost
Stabbed me in the heart
I swear this fucking wound is so raw

[Silver Skye]
Everything you telling him you told me
The way that you would be holding him, you'd hold me
He is doing everything I use to do
And I would have gave the world to you
You're teaching him everything I taught you
Sharing with him everything I bought you
I don't understand, was he a better man?

[JayteKz]
So tell me what the fuck he got that I don't have
Without you, I ain't shit
I mean you were my other half
Is it the money, the clothes, his looks, or the diamond rings?
Is it because I can't afford all of these finer things?
I'm sorry, I told you that I would make it up
I wanted to propose
But I was busy saving up
But you ain't wait for me
Instead, you took my heart away from me
Broke it into pieces, all I got left is this hate in me
Pray for me
I hope one day I be ok
I hope to learn to love again and find my soulmate
I hope she loves me through my flaws and my imperfections
Be the center of her love just like an intersection
And as time goes on
I hope you realize that you fucking chose wrong
I'm the one for you
But you were blind to what's in front of you
Through all of my suffering
I still can't get enough of you

[Silver Skye]
Everything you telling him you told me
The way that you would be holding him, you'd hold me
He is doing everything I use to do
And I would have gave the world to you
You're teaching him everything I taught you
Sharing with him everything I bought you
I don't understand, was he a better man?

No I don't, no I don't, no I don't understand
Is he doing everything I didn't
But I know I can
No I don't, no I don't, no I don't understand
Guess you probably right
I guess he is a better man</pre>
