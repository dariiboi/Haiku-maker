Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The American motherfucking dream nigga
Yeah!
On my shit nigga
Drogas, Drogas, Drogas
Where you from nigga?
Read the mothafuckin tag bitch
Salute the flag bitch

My Glock came from Savannah, Georgia
My AR-15 from California
My cocaine come from Arizona
My Detroit whip run quick like Forrest

Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)

Bad little bitch from Miami
Came from Cuba but here with family
When I speak that English she don't understand me
'Cause I speak I speak I speak that Spanish
On my shit

Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)

Ku Klux man from Indiana (Fuck them niggas)
Brought that shit from Alabama
Making it rain, give 'em Atlanta
Making it, making it rain, rain like New Orleans, Louisiana (Yeah!)
That gang shit came from Illinois
That bang shit came from Illinois
That murder rate in Illinois
'Nother AR-15 that bitch that made in Illinois

Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)

That lean cup came from Houston, Texas
For the police was Ruthless Records
Black Panthers was moving breakfast
Bitch your 90s state of mind got me shooting reckless
'Cause I'm made in that fuckin' ghetto
Made in that fuckin' ghetto
You ain't where I'm from bitch
You ain't on my fucking level
And the whole world want my swag
Bloods and Crips and shit all up in my flag
'Cause it's

Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
Made in the U.S.A. (Made in the U.S.A.)
