Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I ain't never been no bitch
Niggas scared of the dark
I was out tackled with the pitch
Same color as the tense
The night time reminds me
Of my niggas in pain
We all seen the hate
Now it's feeling the same
When it comes from my mouth I keep a sip of the plain
When you speak from your heart do you feel the shame
I was mad of the sounds, noises making bad choices
Selling off my soul for Rolls Royces
Keeping real B you gotta make plenty choices
Act like a hoe and you gonna see hell
I come from California
Where the skinny nigga dwell
I want to be in your top five
I'm only one
Kick me up like the only gun
Feel me
Fuck with me
Er'body know Lil B started trends
Niggas came performing like Kim
Soul zips and no phone
And I can't go back in
Nigga's rap that I used to rap
I'm not used to rap
Niggas act like I'm used to rap
Street game kept me on my back
Niggas say you got 5
But he really got 20
Blinds you with the money
Your game got skinny
They say God feed others
You got a silver spoon
I got a plastic running the cover
I ain't different than you
We're the same ass color
But the worries got power
People act like cowards
Being poor mind state
You can take your shower
So why you complain about the day that's ours
Niggas actin like a bitch gonna send them flowers
Niggas rattin' on their partner just to get some power
If you change with the money you always been the coward
Niggas don't respect you you're just a nig
These hoes love money so we kick in the trip
Don't be no dumbass bitch
Sold your soul for the grip fucked niggas in the game
Got the power fucked over sisters
And now my niggas getting richer
Shooting off clips like some mistaking pictures
Don't trust hoes I ain't got no mistress
Give no kitchens, bitch do the dishes
If I go down man I know you be a witness
Can't trust hoes, the game got shifted
Places in the west that will change your own vision
Make you get humble make you thank based God
We all thank Jesus, we know you need it
Rock through the city, so low with the beeper
True dog coupe the same color as my snickers
Riding aside guns holdin blunts with the cloth
Married to the game bitch I never take it off
Been in the jungle where them niggas getting crossed
Niggas with the sharks, damn I got my leg broke
Coming with the chopper like Peg Cole
Niggas they don't act like man
I'm the rawest
Nigga I been lost in the force with the cocaine
Dope game full flight, show you the whole lane
I made history now I want the whole fame
You feel me? I'm coming for the world
I do it for Fer, I do it for the world
I do it for Fer, I do it for the world
RIP Mad dre, RIP all the people
And we lost to the ace
Let's keep it equal
Lil B
