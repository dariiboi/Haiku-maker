Killer killer killer killer killer

[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
I guess you can consider it a poet
But with me it started out with these words, words words
They started lookin like puzzle pieces so I start connectin them to each other
'Til they started to resemble, blank canvases
By this time I was an artist
So I just started to see, these pictures, these real visuals

[Yelawolf]
Psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
A psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
A psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
A psychopath, I'm a killer

[Interlude: singer] + (Yelawolf)
Feel it in the air, breathe it in the night
Starin at the full moon (killer killer killer killer)
Did you ever think, you would come to find? (killer killer killer killer)
Maybe in my dream (a psychopath, I'm a killer)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin in class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin up, pissed off
Probably symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin nightmares of leavin behind my dreams
with anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong and I'm standin in front of a gun
I'm puttin myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein with a wizard
Every award show we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin that's so lyrical to a kid
who wouldn't know what was hittin if it hit him? (hit him, hit him)
Now I wanna talk about these niggaz from Detroit
Before me and Shady, who was thinkin 'bout Detroit?
We put the world onto it
So watch how you say "Fuck me"
You just might jinx yourself, whoops, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in the 9-11
in Chicago, 9:11 at the same time
I had already been grindin since '9-7
That's longevity and if you think you're lyrically better you better be a killer

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
OHH you ain't never seen a motherfucker get realer
A psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
A psychopath, I'm a killer (killer killer killer killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no ain't nobody for realer
A psychopath, I'm a killer

[Crooked I/KXNG CROOKED]
This elite drinker is the ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher with a street sweeper
full of heat seekers in your Jeep speakers
I'ma keep ringers, I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
Niggaz try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the LAUGH to the T-E-R
HO, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks
Word, makin work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flippin bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula
Has him a spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexin?
Fuck yes with the goon talk, I just moonwalk all over the beat
then I'm lightin up the street
Crooked goin Michael Jackson on "Thriller"

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Eminem]
The thought of retirin
is makin me wanna set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and
What up mom, applyin for the rim job, are you hirin?
I'm hopin to fill up your openin, oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you're in the lobby and the aisle and
you've probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am in
no mood to be playin second fiddle, slob on this violin
with no strings attached, I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein brought up so brought up inspired
but I don't know why, it's still like I'm
caught up inside a +Whirlpool+, not an appliance
But applyin this science I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance, heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin, the twine like a beanstalk and a vine
But I keep walkin the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can
still cause in the fabric of our modern society, now Catholics are panickin
cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Damn it the pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican
with that mannequin singin "Bagpipes From Baghdad" again
in my dad's drag draggin a faggot in
a +GLAAD+, bag, won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again
You thought I was lyin when I said I think that I'm crossin the line again
I've lost my mind, caution, oh God I think I just thought of another fuckin line
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
But hip-hop has left me brainwashed with a violent
... streak... defiant
Now the odds of me tryin to fuckin be quiet
probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
after he's fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive
colony tryin to sneak by it
While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap!
I'ma start up a riotin, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin attire in
Boston, across the Marathon finish line and I
put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life
worse than Dzhokhar's and I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fuckin swiss army knife
A saber-less Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
with the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end!
Like fuck 'em all, I'm just ridin
Like I'm locked up inside of a shot-up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie was drivin, 'bout to barge through the side door
of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room~!

[Chorus]
