Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm so in love with you
Baby can't you fucking see
I give you everything you need
Plus the air I breathe
But you don't feel the same
I can tell some things have changed
You and I together were like heaven
Now we burn in flames
Shit, tell me what you do behind my back
I see you staring at your phone
And all these smiles crack
But when I ask you just say I'm insecure
But tell me why you acting distant
Raising my suspicion whore
Fuck, I'm going crazy and I hate this shit
I don't believe a word you say just like an atheist
Or maybe its just me
Maybe you deserve a chance
But fuck that that
That's not the case within this circumstance
I peeped over at your phone
Yo who the fuck is lance?
Why you calling baby
Why the fuck you making plans?
This can't be real
Yo what the fuck is going on?
This sneaky bitch played me out
I've known it all along

Tell me why the fuck you break my heart?
You tore it into pieces
Should have known right from the start
You were my light
Now you left me lost within the dark
Ill get my payback
I promise bitch you'll pay the cost
For all the pain you brought
You gon feel it 10 fold
Ain't got shit to lose like I was stuck on death row
So when I find you
I swear that I'm going to fucking kill you
And don't you beg for help bitch
Cuz I will not forgive you

Keeping tired I was screaming out a fucking storm
But on the outside I was quiet, cool, and keeping calm
Cuz when I get the chance
I promise imma catch a case
Imma find out who he is
And fucking slice his face
So we got back to my crib
And then we chilled a bit
Around 12 am she told me it was time to dip
And then she grabbed the keys and said
"Baby I love you I never wanna lose you"
Yeah whatever bitch fuck you
So I got inside my car and then I followed her
Tryna keep my distance making sure I wouldn't startle her
10 minutes passed she finally got to her destination
Mask around my face like it was Freddy vs Jason
Then I walked up the house; machete in my hand
Imma kill his ass exactly where he stands
Fucking both yo their nightmare has just begun
You told me that you loved me
Promised me that I was the one

Tell me why the fuck you break my heart?
You tore it into pieces
Should have known right from the start
You were my light
Now you left me lost within the dark
Ill get my payback
I promise bitch you'll pay the cost
For all the pain you brought
You gon feel it 10 fold
Ain't got shit to lose like I was stuck on death row
So when I find you
I swear that I'm going to fucking kill you
And don't you beg for help bitch
Cuz I will not forgive you

So I walked up to the door
Then left it slightly cracked
Stepped a foot inside
From this point on
There's no going back
As I was searching for my heart
Beat going fast
Overwhelmed with anger
I was anxious just to choke his ass
And there they were
They were posted on the couch
Holding hands, kissing intimately, tongue up in his mouth
Yo couldn't stand the sight
So I came up from behind
I took one last look
And then that bitch started flying
Hit him in his fucking neck
Then I stabbed in the chest
I go "This is what you get dirty bitch where's my respect?"
Cuz I gave you everything
Even had a wedding ring
Can you feel the pain you caused me?
Well good bitch let it sting
I really meant it when I told you That I'd kill for you
So don't you question why this fucking blood has spilled for you
I really loved you but you took my love for granted
I hope you live happily ever after with your new companion

Tell me why the fuck you break my heart?
You tore it into pieces
Should have known right from the start
You were my light
Now you left me lost within the dark
Ill get my payback
I promise bitch you'll pay the cost
For all the pain you brought
You gon' feel it 10 fold
Ain't got shit to lose like I was stuck on death row
So when I find you
I swear that I'm going to fucking kill you
And don't you beg for help bitch
Cuz I will not forgive you</pre>
