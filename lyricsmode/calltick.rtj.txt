{"Live, Li-Li-Li-Li-Live from the Garden!"}

[Intro]
Yeah, uhh
Yeah, RTJ
All, all, all damn day

[El-P]
Run The Jewels live at the Garden
Lickin off shots and we aim for the darkness
Make it get hot for a target
Kids cook s'mores off the crotch of our targets 
Kumbaya, bitch~! Bucker up, lil' trooper
Can't get past me, I'm stuck in the future
The shit ain't all it's cracked up to be
The hovercraft's cool but the air's so putrid

[Killer Mike]
You can tell by the stench in the air
Blood's on the ground, opportunity is here
I'm lookin' into space like "Is anybody there?
And if aliens are here, please tell me how near
Do you come in peace or should everybody fear?
I'll wait your reply with a blunt and a beer"
I be the high guy with the belly and the beard
Smoke signal E.T., ATLiens here

[Chorus: El-P]
Beggin your pardon, Run The Jewels live at the Garden
{"Li-Li-Li, Li-Li, Live from the Garden!"}
{..."Li-Li, Live from the Garden!"}
{"Li-Li-Li, Li-Li, Live from the Garden!"}
Run The Jewels live at the Garden
Run The Jewels {"Live from the Garden!"}
Ru-Ru-Run The Jewels {"Live from the Garden!"}
{"Li-Li-Li, Li-Li, Live from the-"}

[El-P]
Beggin your pardon, Run The Jewels live at the Garden
Last two pirates alive and still yargin ("Yaaaarg!")
My girl got my heart, it's a bargain
Lick from her lips to the crease in her garter
Her ass my religion, love's why I'm livin
Smoke farm to face by the field full, partner
Life's a shitnado, the smoke my umbrella
The boy's back turnin his slacks to all yella
Prick~! It's a daily lick
I slit throats with a grin that reek of pure shit
Travel by backflip, eat from the river
The panther heart taught to talk by smart chicks
Sip pure venom and skipped away grinnin
I put that on mom, she ain't raise a (Vic!)
Lil' fucknuts, sit
I piss on your wit, dismiss your whole shit

[Killer Mike]
Live from the stage of the Garden
We be the realest of the killers of the fuck shit squadron
Movin' through the streets and we lootin,' robbin'
Mobbin', marchin', carryin' a carbine
Hello everybody, this is now bank robbery
Jesse James gang, we'll walk you through the process
You don't wanna be a hero, do not let that thought process
We will put a bullet where your thoughts get processed
Get that fuck shit straight like a perm or a process
cause for real, the money money ain't the motherfuckin' object
We just like excitement, gun fights, indictments
High speed chase through Manhattan in the night winds
Ooh, its the thrill of the kill
Watchin' "Kill Bill" on a pill as I grip steerin' wheel
Cops coulda had the boy jammed I fear
But like Eddie Kane, I made it, I'm here

[Chorus]

[Killer Mike]
I'm the shumma-luma-duma-luma, danger dick'll do your mama
Skeeter with the peeter, never eat her, tell her see ya later
Holla 'bout tomorrow, baby, I ain't got to holler
*HRMM HRMM* my Impala, pop a pussy, pop a collar
Pop a pill then chill, no Bill, no Cosby
Not a raper or a taker, bonafide heartbreaker
Hit her once, hit her twice, then tell her see ya later
Got head, watch Vice at her home in Decatur

[El-P]
Full clip, I'm a little bit sick, come equipped
Look at what I did for the grit, got it lit, what a cinch
Brought 'em just a little pinch of the truth and they flip
Now they hangin' from my shit little bit
It's the Mensch, the myth
I do push-ups nude on the edge of cliffs
The jewels come quick, all gold and brick
Click click, boxer cutter spit, brother what a trip

[Chorus]
