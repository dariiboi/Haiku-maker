"The force shall arrive, to reclaim what is his"

Vinnie Paz. Priest of Bloodshed.

"Powers that leave, will be shaken."
"The force shall arrive, do you understand? "

Yeah. What's up motherfuckers? I'm back again
Pazienza, you know what I'm saying? Vinnie Paz
The Priest of Bloodshed. DJ Kwestion on the zigga-zigga
You know what I'm sayin'? Jedi Mind is in the building
The G-O-D Jus Allah, you know he with me as always
You know what I'm sayin'? Outerspace, AOTP, Official Pistol Gang
You kna mean? Priest of Bloodshed. Some new shit that I did
some guest appearances I did, y'all might not heard, y'all might have heard
You know we keep the flavor moving all day everyday
Enough of the talk, yo we gon' get into the music
Yo Kwest, beat these mothafuckas in the head
