Song:   Deja Vu
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop (off top)
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, this the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights off

And put my number in it..
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
Cause you a starâ€”no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time
I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop (off top)
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, this the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights off

And put my number in it

I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
Cause I can see the promise land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
Cause I can see the promise land
But I can't do no promising

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want it</pre>
