Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I close my eyes and let my mind contemplate
Would i be satisfied if I died today?
Would i be happy with the person I'm becoming?
A dollar in the dream I'm trying to turn into something
If its nothing
Well, at least I tried right?
I've been patiently waiting for when my time is right
But then I stop and quickly ask myself

What happens when life brakes down?

What happens when your life just breaks down?
You beg for help but no response, not a single sound
And all you got is you
The voices in your head, you try to drown them out
But they overflow instead
You think you're dead cuz your thoughts are going up
You're boxed up in your corner not a single place to run
You're asking for forgiveness but you ain't gettin' shit back
So you sit back and lose yourself within these tracks
It's how my life works
It's all I ever do
I get confused [?]
I never knew that my voice would be global
Fans around the world
Yo my shits no longer local
Hopefully, this is just the start of something beautiful
Music for the soul way more further than the usual

And if I die play my music at my funeral
And if I die play my music at my funeral

My dad is still in prison
Yo nothing hasn't changed
He's still stuck behind in a cell with some fucking chains
When will it change?
When will he find his way out?
Cuz I've been waiting my whole life for this day now
I'm losing all my patience
My temper's running short
So fuck a law, fuck a cop, and the fucking court
Yo fuck a judge and fuck the whole system
You take a man's life and you tell me who's the fucking victim
And that's the world that we live in
Catered to the rich while we're fed like some pigeons
Slipping at the bottom so we can never rise
It's fucked up when they sugarcoat the truth with the lies
So i stay loyal to myself
Family and god ain't no room for no one else
I promise you imma change the world day by day
And imma bring you hope with ever word i gotta say
And if they kill me then fuck it i go out with a bang
My brains every where just to let my thoughts hang
There's blood upon this mic to these rappers know i came
I'm in it for the passion fuck the money and the fame
I do this for my fans, I do this for my dad
I do this for the ones that never had a dream to catch
I do this for myself cuz this is what I love
I started out with nothing now just watch what I become</pre>
