Artist: Smoothe Da Hustler
Album:  Once Upon a Time in America
Song:   Fuck Whatcha Heard
Typed by: Matt Jost

[Intro: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Hill Playaz Clique
Live and direct
Strictly
It's all about money
Everything's the same
Saratoga Ave
Representin
Smoothe Da Hustler clique
Nexx Level
Check it

[VERSE 1: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Fuck whatcha heard, my word'll be 3rd degree
Manslaughter, C felony, class A burglary - ya heard of me
The massacre, movin after ya, the faster ya (RUUUN!)
The harder I'ma pull the trigger to Casper ya
Niggas know the style now, Smoothe the wild child
Wild Style, '95 I'm down now, they say I'm foul now
Fuck y'all
Cause I been rockin since
Pin-striped Lee's, 560 MB's
For those that think they housin shit I'm stoppin rent
Your title don't concern me
You learn in order to burn me
You gotta get open cause I close deals like A&R's and attorneys
Without the delay, no replay
In rap divisions I hold more records than my DJ
No relays, I'm runnin marathons for bein sick
Put Jerry Lewis with the clique
Now he sell tapes at his Telethon
Bring the illest nigga, the realest nigga to feel this nigga
I'll send him home to his Bruce Willis niggas
Sayin: 'We got to kill this nigga'

[CHORUS: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Fuck whatcha heard
Here's a Brownsville wild killer
Project strangler, blood spiller

[VERSE 2: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I always knew I had Big Willie potential
Drop the raps on tracks, drop the tracks on wax, now it's official
I crash you, who gassed you?
Niggas talkin outta turn and out they ass too
Nigga, who asked you? I blast you
High screams'll turn to yodels
Can't You See my Notorious Big gun I pack'll leave ya Total-ed
The mass destructer, cash conducter, class instructor
You crossed Da Hustler's path at last, muthafucka
I got that ass, the hostage holder
The ransom note taped with CB4 explosives
With my name written across the folder
Smoothe Da Hustler reppin, strictly keep my weapon with me
Niggas steppin quickly, die quicker when I'm high, nigga
Hold up - whoever wanna rumble
Fuck the rumors and all that bullshit
When you see me bring it, if you ain't, shut the fuck up
I stuck up, Lucky Charms, met him at the rainbow
Caught the pot o' gold and his four leaf clover, fucked his luck up
My Hill niggas from the avenue ain't havin you
Slip up, I'm quick to throw the clip up and start crabbin you

[HOOK: Trigger Tha Gambler]

[VERSE 3: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I bring the drama straight from Saratoga Ave.
Get more letters than that Abby bitch
Straight Out of Brooklyn like Matty Rich
(Brownsville)
It's suicidal, takin my title
Cause my freestyle recital is vital
Silly and more slicker than Billy Idol
I'm breakin herbs down better than stick shifts with clutches
Stiff dick touches clits like Brownsville lips to dutches
I'm nothin to fuck with, you couldn't oppose this
Hill niggas be takin AB's while I be splittin C's like I'm Moses
I lyrically kill shit, so grab the red tape
I turn live niggas to dead weight, so get that head straight
Gangsta niggas talk the wrong shit
Fuck rappin and live it
Fuck who you down with, who you know, or did a song with
I'm out for self, the streets got me hip
So I pack steel, my rap open ears to keep me GQ to the tip
I flip and break fool, that's word to mother
Playin niggas soft, they break north
Cause I come off like a used rubber</pre>
