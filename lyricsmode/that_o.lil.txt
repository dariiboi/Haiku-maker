[Chorus]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
'Cause you're the one baby the only one for me,
You're the one honey, the only one I need

[Verse 1]
Can I spit a couple of facts and facts
Most of my facts just facts all I
Man all they do is facts
I been looking for a bitch that pretty
Got kids man and he don't pay rent
Bitch you get nosey, and niggas got hoes like OJ come back
Like ok I'm doing, bitch I'm ok
Your life is ruined, how you felt last night
Sick to your stomach most hoes lie like Jerry Springer
You feel me, don't go back to sing it
Go in the grammy
Too complex with your toes bitch you're gonna marry me
OG you feel me,
Got that pyrose
Everything shoot bitch, toast!
You know it man I'm not this boy you know me
Rocking hard, like I said
That's your boy lil B
PYT mixtape
You know we're rocking out
Like I said it's your boy Lil B

[Chorus]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
'Cause you're the one baby the only one for me
You're the one honey, the only one I need

[Verse 2]
Now I need a bitch that fuck like this
And roll like this, and roll like this
4 door wheel, 4 door wheel
Blow with the tense, don't pay rent
Bitch don't pay rent, sky mask on
I need that lane
Don't like me
Get along bitch
Faint to the floor
I need that dough
Hot as gold
I'm on the road
Late night thuggin all night
I need that hoe

[Chorus]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
'Cause you're the one baby the only one for me
You're the one honey, the only one I need
