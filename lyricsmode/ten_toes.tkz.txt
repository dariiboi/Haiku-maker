Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, take a look into my fucking eyes
Can you see all of my sorrow mixed with pain inside
I ain't sure about tomorrow, shit i want to die
I've been depressed for a while now I'm sick and tired
I'm so fucked up I really need some help
but how can you help me if I can't even help myself
I'm so disappointed
Voices telling me to pick your poison
you either OD or shoot yourself, Just do a coin flip
I’m so broken, ain’t no way you can fix me
If I pull the trigger who the fuck will really miss me
Kiss me on my forehead when i'm inside my casket
Never gave a fuck but all of a sudden start to ass kiss
I know those times, develop love for you over night
But where was you when I had no one to hold me tight
No where in sight, so motherfuck no condolences
Born in 1994 and I've been lonely since.. Yeah, said I've been lonely since
Had my family torn apart and we've been broken since
Took my dad away before I took my first breath
Took my dad away before he'd seen my first steps
How the fuck do you think I feel when I look back at it?
I start to choke up and panic like i'm hazmatic
Bad habits form so I can try to avoid the void
After fact my whole family has been destroyed
A couple months back my life changed
dad's home but our connection feels quite strange
It's not the same like it once was in prison
I used to feel so close but now I feel so fucking distant
And it hurts me, I swear to god this shit hurts me
cause I don't feel like, "Yo son I feel that I'm worthy."
And I ain't saying this to try to bash you dad
I'm only saying this because you lost in touch on what we had
You used to ask about me, show concern for what I'm doing
asking about my music and these dreams that i'm pursuing
now all you ever talk about is problems with these women
It's funny how it happened, showing up all of a sudden
But don't forget, when you were locked up we were always there
All you had was us when you was going through despair
Family is everything so don't you lose sight of that
I'm only saying this cause I love you and I want you back
Yeah, I said I want you back
I would do anything to keep our love and bonding tact
We can't forget about our past and where we both been, cause all we had was each other through both thick and thin

You're my heart, mind and soul pops
You're my treasure, You're my gold pops
And your heart is where I'm home pops
Without you I am not home pops

Love You...</pre>
